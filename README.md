# Illinois Institute of Technology course CS522 Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews Project

Implemented an automatic sentiment polarity classifier in R for movie reviews. Used various machine learning classification techniques such as Naïve Bayes, support vector machines, random forests and logistic regression to classify reviews as positive or negative. Results with logistic regression on n-grams showed 14% improvement over random forest and naïve bayes classifiers.
